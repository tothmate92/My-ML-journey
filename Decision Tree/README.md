## Introduction

In this project, we will constructing a decision tree classifier using the Drug 200 dataset. The primary objective is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the optimal drug type for patients based on various attributes.

## Dataset

The Drug 200 dataset, available on Kaggle, is our focus. It contains basic information about patients and the drugs they've been prescribed. We have five different drug types labeled as A, B, C, X, and Y.

Each entry in the dataset includes details like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and serum concentrations of sodium and potassium. The main thing we're trying to predict is which drug type would be most effective for a particular patient based on these characteristics.
